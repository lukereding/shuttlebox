# shuttlebox experiment

This repo contains code to

1.  create stimulus videos to use in shuttlebox experiments in fish and   
2. track the fish in the resulting videos

Conveniently, there is a subdirectory for each of these.

The main tracking results so far are shown in the Jupyter notebook in the `tracking` subdirectory.

Very much a WIP.
